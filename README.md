# gerrymandering-apma-seminar
Code demo for the Applied Mathematics senior seminar at Columbia University, Fall 2022. Based on templates and code from the GerryChain package. 

To replicate the code that generates the ensemble and maps as seen in presentation slides:
- Download the PA.zip files from https://github.com/mggg-states/PA-shapefiles.
- Put the "Gerrychain Demo" notebook in the same folder as the data (do not forget to extract the files). 
- Run the notebook. The chain can take over two hours to run. If you want to reduce this time, run it with fewer steps.
